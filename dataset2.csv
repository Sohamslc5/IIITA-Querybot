,"During the early days in the year 1999, the institute had started in a modest rented setup at nehru science centre (nsc) of allahabad university campus.. The nsc complex included five workshops, eight computer laboratories, five lecture halls, a conference room, auditorium, library, cafeteria, office space and other facilities.. The total covered area was about 25,000 sq.ft.. Besides this, there was an open space of 50,000 sq.ft.. That was used for parking, lawns and sporting activities.later, iiit allahabad was established at jhalwa in the outskirts of allahabad, spread in a sprawling 100 acres land near devghat.. The architecture of this institution is unique and contemporary in nature and makes a statement about the fibonacci series of binary bits, in a serious deviation from the established pattern.. Instead of the traditional geometric lines, the campus and other buildings have been styled on patterns developed by internationally acclaimed scholar and mathematician, roger penrose.initially, apart from the bachelor of technology (b.tech) in information technology, iiit allahabad was offering a specialized masterÃ¢Â’s degree (m.tech in it) in three specializations namely, intelligent systems, wireless communication and bioinformatics.. Later, three new post graduate course works were added as ms in cyber law, mba in it and m.tech in software engineering.. In due course, other specialization topics were added into the pool of m.tech with specializations like robotics, human computer interaction and microelectronics.during the period (2008-2014 ), iiit allahabad became the only institute to organize 7 consecutive science conclaves, a meeting wherein noble laureates, turing awardees, best scientists from india and abroad world come at a common platform to inspire and impart knowledge to the budding engineers..

,"During the early days in the year 1999, the institute had started in a modest rented setup at Nehru Science Centre (NSC) of Allahabad University campus. The NSC complex included five workshops, eight computer laboratories, five lecture halls, a conference room, auditorium, library, cafeteria, office space and other facilities. The total covered area was about 25,000 sq.ft. Besides this, there was an open space of 50,000 sq.ft. that was used for parking, lawns and sporting activities.Later, IIIT Allahabad was established at Jhalwa in the outskirts of Allahabad, spread in a sprawling 100 acres land near Devghat. The architecture of this institution is unique and contemporary in nature and makes a statement about the Fibonacci series of binary bits, in a serious deviation from the established pattern. Instead of the traditional geometric lines, the campus and other buildings have been styled on patterns developed by internationally acclaimed scholar and mathematician, Roger Penrose.Initially, apart from the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Information Technology, IIIT Allahabad was offering a specialized MasterÃ‚Â’s Degree (M.Tech in IT) in three specializations namely, Intelligent Systems, Wireless Communication and Bioinformatics.
